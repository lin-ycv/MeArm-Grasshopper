# MeArm-Grasshopper
IK solver for MeArm using Kangaroo 2


Kinematics is solved thru simulation (Kangaroo), therefore some inaccuracies is to be expected. This shouldn't be an issue, since meArm isn't highly accurate to begin with.


To use a custom sized meArm, CAD your own 2D skeleton by referencing this:
